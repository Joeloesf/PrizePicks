# PrizePicks

An attempt at predicting over/unders in basketball sports betting using web-scraped statistics. Written as I was learning Python, and was primarily a learning activity (it didn't end up making any money LOL).

Wrote this code in Spring of 2023, but only uploaded to GitHub in Spring of 2024.
